## What is ArmCord?
ArmCord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight. 

## Will I get banned for using this?   
You are breaking [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services) by using ArmCord, but no one has been banned from using it or any of the client mods included.

## Can I use this on anything other than ARM?
Yes! ArmCord should work normally under Windows, MacOS and Linux as long as it has Electron support.

## How does this work?   
We are using the official web app and adding some magic powder to make it all work!

## Where can I find the source code?
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord/).
