      <Card title="Made for Privacyâ„¢">
        ArmCord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure! We also don't collect any data from you.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Much more stable">
        ArmCord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Mobile support">
        ArmCord has experimental mobile/touch support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Standalone client">
        ArmCord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way. No Discord code here and no injectors!
